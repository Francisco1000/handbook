  abstract  = {
A major step towards secure Internet backbone routing started with the
 deployment of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). It allows
 for the cryptographic strong binding of an IP prefix and autonomous
 systems that are legitimate to originate this prefix. A fundamental
 design choice of RPKI-based prefix origin validation is the avoidance
 of cryptographic load at BGP routers. Cryptographic verifications will
 be performed only by cache servers, which deliver valid AS/prefix
 mappings to the RPKI-enabled BGP router using the RPKI/RTR protocol.

In this paper, we give first insights into the additional system load
 introduced by RPKI at BGP routers. For this purpose, we design and
 implement a highly efficient C library of the RPKI/RTR router part and
 the prefix origin validation scheme. It fetches and stores validated
 prefix origin data from an RTR-cache and performs origin verification
 of prefixes as obtained from BGP updates. We measure a relatively small
 overhead of origin validation on commodity hardware (5\% more RAM than
 required for full BGP table support, 0.41\% load in case of ca. 92,000
 prefix updates per minute), which meets real-world requirements of today.
